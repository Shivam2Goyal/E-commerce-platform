            Most people follow a tutorial to build a site; we built a platform to solve the
            "where did I put that receipt?" problem—then turned it into this. 
            This project was built by <b>Shivam Goyal</b> and <b>Dikshant Jha</b>, combining logic with a designer’s eye for aesthetics.

            While the "Forever" brand was the starting point, the underlying engine—from the MERN stack integration to the AI-optimized asset pipeline—was engineered to prove that high-fashion retail can have high-performance code. We don't just ship products; we ship clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.
